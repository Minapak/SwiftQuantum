# SwiftQuantum App - Tab Guide

Complete guide for all features in the SwiftQuantum (SuperpositionVisualizer) app.
Written in simple terms so anyone can understand!

## Tab 1: Lab (Laboratory)

### What is it?
The Lab is your personal quantum physics laboratory! You can play with quantum bits (qubits) and see how they behave.

### Main Features

| Feature | What it does | Why it's cool |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Bloch Sphere** | Shows where a qubit "points" in 3D | See quantum states as a ball! |
| **Gate Controls** | Apply quantum operations | Like pressing buttons to change the qubit |
| **Measurement** | Collapse the quantum state | Find out if it's 0 or 1 |
| **Phase Display** | Shows rotation angles | Understand quantum phases |

### Simple Explanation

Imagine a coin that's both heads AND tails at the same time - that's a qubit in superposition!

- **Hadamard Gate (H)**: Makes the coin spin so it's both heads and tails
- **Pauli-X Gate**: Flips the coin from heads to tails
- **Pauli-Z Gate**: Rotates the coin but keeps it in the same up/down state
- **Measure**: Stop the coin and see what you got!

### What You'll Learn
- How qubits work
- What superposition really means
- Why quantum computers are different from regular computers
